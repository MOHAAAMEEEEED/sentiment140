Twitter sentiment analysis is a popular use case for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. 

In social networks, twitter for example, is the  ideal place for anyone to post their ideas and  thoughts, but to avoid the spread of hateful  tweets ,it is necessary to have an automated system capable of detecting the  nature of the feelings behind a text. Given a collection of tweets, the system should accurately classify each tweet into one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral associated with a particular tweet, enabling deeper insights into public opinion, customer feedback, brand perception, and market trends.

## performing supervised learning on the data using the following classifiers/deep learning models:
### multinomial Naive Bayes
### Logistic Regression
### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with LSTM layer
